### NYC 311 Data Analysis
 
This report explores a real-world dataset from NYC 311, the official non-emergency service platform for New York City. The system enables residents to report issues ranging from noise complaints and sanitation problems to street condition and police-related concerns. The dataset contains hundreds of thousands of entries, each representing a unique service request submitted by city residents. 
 
The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a structured analysis of the dataset through three main phases: data understanding, data preparation, and data analysis. Initially, we examine the framework, content and quality of the datasets to detect relevant fields and defects in the dataset. In the second phase, we clean and prepare the operational data for analysis. In the final phase, we compare the datasets statistically with the goal of obtaining trends, patterns, and issues of concern related to how the city operates any of its services. 

This analysis helps understand the scope, scale, and nature of urban complaints in NYC, and provides insights into how efficiently different types of issues are resolved across boroughs and agencies.
